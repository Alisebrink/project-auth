# Boardgame management system
## A final project by Linnea Isebrink for Technigo frontend bootcamp

This is a boardgame management system.

The user can create a user, login and then add and manage their collection of board games.

Application is CRUD which means you can CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE to the database. 

### Endpoints

Time management has been the biggest issue during this project. I've constantly felt that I've needed more time than what I had. I also had bigger plans than what I've finally managed to create. If I would've had more time I would have created a search/filter functionality where the user can filter their collection. I also would've liked to add a way of earning achievements depending on how many and what kinds of game you have in your collection. 

I also would've liked to have a more advanced profile page where the user could upload an image and edit their profile.
